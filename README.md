## TODOs

  - Better handle collisions of multiple entities.
  - Improve error correction on collisions.

### Improvements

- Collisions between different types of entities, e.g spheres, boxes, polygons maybe?

- Package the module and deploy to NPM
- Clean up the examples to all use the latest features of the module.
