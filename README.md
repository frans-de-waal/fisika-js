## TODOs

### Bugs

- Fix (?) drag calculation.
- Update collisions to:
  - Better handle collisions of multiple entities.
  - Improve error correction on collisions.

### Improvements

- Allow adding forces to examples.
- Collisions between different types of entities, e.g spheres, boxes, polygons maybe?
- Rigid bodies (rotation).
